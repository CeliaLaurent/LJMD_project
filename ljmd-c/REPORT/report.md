### Collaborative project on MD code optimization (Group 4) 

##### Team members: Alberto Cazzaniga, Celia Laurent, Antonio Sciarappa, Miguel Castellano.

#### 1. Introduction

For this project, we're given a simplified code to run molecular dynamics simulations in C and the goal is to implement a python interface along with a series of optimizations including parallelization schemes for MPI and OpenMP in a collaborative way, using continuous integration. 

#### 2. Work

The work developed during the project can be split in two parts: The realization of a Python interface in charge of calling the time-critical functions from C and the implementation of a bunch of optimizations to speed up the code plus the addition of both an MPI and OpenMP parallelization schemes aimed at providing a certain sense of scalability. 

For the first part, we wrote a python script that acted as an interface to the C code by implementing the same C functions in Python and calling only the time-critical functions from C by making use of ctypes and shared library handles.

For the second part, distributed memory parallelization was added by means of MPI directives into the code while shared memory multi-threading was enabled in a peculiar, more performant but also more memory consuming way using OpenMP pragmas. As for the optimizations, we implemented the in-lining of frequently called functions, re-formulation of expensive mathematical operations, vectorization and others.

#### 3. Timing parallel application

We run our hybrid C code on the Galileo cluster in Bologna. The times obtained for Argon with 2916 atoms are summarized in the following plot:

![](Timing.png)

The timings seems to scale well across various values for number of MPI processes and OPENMP threads. The best performance obtained reached a speedup of **x50.7** with respect to the serial code run with appropriate gcc flags.

Unfortunately we did not have time to run the Python code on the cluster, but the timing on our laptops and Travis are not too far from the C results.

#### 4. Optimization


We follow the optimisation strategies suggested. We briefly comment the results obtained in the various phases. All the profiling has been run on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz machine, with dual core and hyperthreading disabled.

- adapted our optimizations to the openmpi layer. Unexpectedly get a further speedup given reducing number of instructions. 
- reached **x12.1 speedup**

##### Last optimization

We try to improve possibilities of having vectorization and make use of spatial locality by creating two temporary buffers (one for positions R and one for forces F) inside the force function, see files ```force.c``` and ```force_mpi.c``` in ```ljmd-c/src/new``` forlder. Further improvement could be given by changing the all data structure sys, but due to time constraint we leave this for future work.

- reduce further the number of instructions. Slightly lower instruction per cycle but still a good value.
- we reach a **x13.7 speedup**.
